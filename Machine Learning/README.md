These are examples of machine learning projects I have completed at University.\n
Coursework 1: Analysing data regarding different fruits and using K-Means classifier to label new objects using their features.\n
Coursework 2: Using unsupervised learning to create 5 classes of colours from a 4K image of a parrot. (If you run this it will take a while, it comes with checkpoints that are pre-loaded).\n
Coursework 3: Using the Viterbi Algorithm to predict a state of an event given its predecessors.
